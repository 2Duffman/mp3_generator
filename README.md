# Generating MP3s for the names of Countries and Capitals
This was a hobby project because I wanted to have mp3 files for my study in Anki.

The code scrapes API notation for the names from Wiktionary and converts this into mp3 using amazonaws.
The results are ok, sadly Wiktionary does not have IPA notation for all countries/capitals.
Also I keep having weird git issues with this project, I really should take some time to learn a standard workflow for git.
